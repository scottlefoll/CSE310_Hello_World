# CSE310_Hello_World
BYUI CSE310 Hello World Code

# Overview

I learned how to utilize Git hub from the command line. In the past I had always used Git only from the Git GUI or from within VS Code.

The aim of this assignment is to learn and implement a Git hub repository for each of the modules for CSE 310. The code and related files will be safely maintained in the Git repo, and versions will be available in case the code needs to be stepped back.

This particular code example is a python "Hello World" program.

The following is a brief video demo of the code in this assignment:
